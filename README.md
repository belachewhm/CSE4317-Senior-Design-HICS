# CSE4317-Senior-Design-HICS

HICS, an intelligent home irrigation control system, was our undergraduate 
capstone project at The University of Texas at Arlington. It was developed 
over the span of two consecutive semesters in the courses CSE 4316 - Senior 
Design I & CSE 4317 - Senior Design II.

HICS is a system that utilizes soil moisture sensors to measure the amount 
of moisture present in a user’s lawn and use this information to water the 
lawn in an efficient way. Rain and temperature sensors help prevent watering 
when unnecessary. The sensors, hardware, and their proper integration and 
programming make HICS a machine that’s smart enough to save people time, 
effort, and money on their home irrigation system. Its purpose is to replace 
an existing sprinkler control system and allow users to control their home 
irrigation remotely through a web application that will scale to fit on a 
computer or mobile device. 

HICS uses a central control unit to read soil moisture levels and set watering 
schedules by interfacing directly with the users existing irrigation valves. The 
control unit allows users to remotely schedule or monitor their lawns by communicating 
with the HICS web application over the Internet. Through the web application, users 
will be granted complete access to all the features that HICS offers while providing 
an intuitive and easy to use interface.
